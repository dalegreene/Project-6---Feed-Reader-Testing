--Project 6: Feed Reader Testing--

This project implemented the use of Jasmine to run tests on several html, css & js files.

To view the page and run the tests, click the index.html file within the main folder.

Seven tests were conducted within the test page to test the page's framework and functionality. 

All tests passed, which is evident on the screen.
